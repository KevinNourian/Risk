    ">* **The Analysis of the Data:** I reviewed approximately 50,000,000 datapoints in 5 tables related to clients in the Home Credit Default Risk Assessment dataset. <br> \n",
    ">* **The Goal of the Project:** The goal of this project was to find a model that could predict if a client will default on a loan. I further wanted to make this determination with as few feature and in the most transparent manner possible.<br>\n",
    ">* **Missing Data:** There was a great deal of missing data in many of the features. I imputed this missing data by assigning a random number to the numerical columns and labeling missing categorical data with the text, \"UNKNOWN\".\"  <br>\n",
    ">* **Models:** I utilized the following models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM).\n",
    ">* **Logistic Regression:** ROC-AUC Score: 0.63.  <br>\n",
    ">* **Random Forest:** ROC-AUC Score: 0.73.   <br>\n",
    ">* **XGBClassifier:** ROC-AUC Score: 0.72.   <br>\n",
    ">* **Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM):** OC-AUC Score: 0.74.   <br>\n",
    ">* **OPTUNA:** I used OPTUNA to tune the hyperparameters of the LGBM model. <br>\n",
    ">* **Final Model (LGBM) with Hyperparameter Tuning:** ROC-AUC Score: 0.77.<br>"

By doing some research, I tried to augment this lack. However, there may be parts of the data that I have overlooked that may have been important and I may have given importance to parts that may have had little significance. <br>\n",
